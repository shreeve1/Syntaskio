# Story 1.2: User Authentication

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want to** be able to sign up and log in to the application,
**so that** I can securely access my personal task information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User authentication is implemented using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Identity Platform.
2. The UI includes functional sign-up and login pages.
3. A user can successfully create an account and log in.
4. Once logged in, the user's session is securely managed.
5. A logged-in user can successfully log out.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1, the monorepo structure is established with:
- Next.js frontend in `apps/web/`
- NestJS backend in `apps/api/`
- Shared types package in `packages/shared-types/`
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest configured
- ESLint and TypeScript configurations in place

### Authentication Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Authentication Service**: GCP Identity Platform - A secure, scalable, and fully-managed authentication service
- **JWT Validation**: NestJS Guards for JWT validation in the backend
- **Session Management**: Secure HttpOnly cookies for token storage
- **Security**: Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and secure cookie configurations

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```
- User has relationships to many Integrations and many Tasks (for future stories)
- User ID should be UUID type as per database schema

### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- REST API with OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification
- Base URL: `/api/v1`
- Authentication endpoints will be added to the API specification

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md#frontend-web-app]
- **Frontend Responsibility**: Manages client-side state and user sessions, communicates with backend via API Gateway
- **API Gateway Responsibility**: Authenticates requests and routes them to appropriate backend microservices
- Technology Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind CSS

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Service Architecture**: NestJS microservices organized into modules by feature
- **Auth Flow**: API Gateway validates JWTs using NestJS Guards
- **Data Access**: Repository Pattern using Prisma ORM

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Component Organization**: Feature-based organization with shared and UI-specific component directories
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state management, organized by domain
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router for file-based routing
- **API Client**: Centralized API client with base URLs and automatic authentication headers

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- **Frontend Security**: Strict Content Security Policy (CSP), secure HttpOnly cookies for tokens
- **Backend Security**: Input validation via NestJS Pipes, rate limiting, strict CORS policy

### File Locations
Based on project structure, new code should be created in:
- Authentication module: `apps/api/src/auth/`
- User model/repository: `apps/api/src/user/`
- Frontend auth pages: `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/`
- Auth components: `apps/web/src/components/auth/`
- Auth state management: `apps/web/src/stores/auth.store.ts`
- Shared User type: `packages/shared-types/src/user.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-coding-error-handling-and-monitoring-standards.md]
- **Testing Strategy**: Adherence to testing pyramid with Vitest for unit/integration tests
- **Test Framework**: Vitest for both frontend and backend testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end authentication flow testing
- **Test Location**: Tests co-located with source files or in __tests__ directories

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript 5.5.x must be used consistently
- ESLint configuration must be shared and enforced
- Error handling must follow standardized format for API responses
- All authentication must integrate with GCP Identity Platform
- JWT tokens must be validated using NestJS Guards
- Session management must use secure HttpOnly cookies

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-coding-error-handling-and-monitoring-standards.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Core authentication service logic, JWT validation, user repository operations
- **Integration Tests**: Authentication endpoints, user creation/login flows, protected route access
- **E2E Tests**: Complete sign-up flow, login flow, logout flow, protected page access
- **Security Tests**: Token validation, session management, rate limiting, CORS policy
