# Requirements
Functional ## Requirements:

FR1: Multi-Source Aggregation: The system must connect to and aggregate tasks from ConnectWise Manage (both tickets and projects), Process Plan (active processes), and Microsoft Todo.

FR2: Real-Time Synchronization: The system must maintain real-time, bi-directional synchronization of task status with the source systems.

FR3: Unified Task Display: The platform will present all tasks in a single, clean, and scannable list that includes clear indicators for the source of each task. Completed tasks will be automatically archived.

FR4: Smart De-duplication: The system will intelligently identify and merge tasks that are similar or duplicates from across the different integrated platforms.

FR5: AI-Powered Enhancement: Each task will display a single, key insight generated by AI (using Perplexity) by default. A user-initiated "Enhance this task" option will provide more detailed, multi-format assistance, including text guides, Mermaid diagrams, and code snippets.

FR6: Source-Cited AI Content: All content generated by the AI enhancement feature must include citations for its sources.

FR7: Core Task Interaction: Users must be able to click on a task to navigate directly to it in the source system. They must also be able to mark a task as complete, which will sync back to the source. The interface must provide basic filtering and search functionality.

Non-Functional ## Requirements:

NFR1: Platform & Browser Support: The application must be a responsive web platform, optimized for both desktop and tablet use. It must support the two most recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

NFR2: Performance: The user-facing application must achieve a page load time of less than 3 seconds. The AI enhancement feature must deliver its results in under 3 seconds.

NFR3: Synchronization Reliability: The synchronization between Syntaskio and the source systems must be at least 99.9% accurate.

NFR4: Integration Security: All connections to external services must be secured using the OAuth2 protocol.

NFR5: Cost Efficiency: Given the self-funded nature of the MVP, the infrastructure and services used must be optimized for cost-efficiency.

NFR6: API Rate Limit Compliance: The system must operate within the API rate limits defined by the source systems (ConnectWise, Process Plan, Microsoft).
