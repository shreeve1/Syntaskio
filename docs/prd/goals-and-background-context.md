# Goals and Background Context
Goals:

Launch an MVP within 4 months that includes core aggregation and AI enhancement features.

Achieve an 85% user retention rate after 30 days of use.

Reduce the average time users spend on task completion by 30%.

Reach a milestone of 1,000 active users within six months of the official launch.

Background Context:
The primary problem Syntaskio aims to solve is the fragmentation of tasks across multiple platforms, which leads to inefficiencies such as context switching and a lack of clear guidance on how to complete complex tasks. Knowledge workers currently spend approximately 2.5 hours each day managing tasks across different systems and lose about 20% of their work time searching for information to complete these tasks. Existing solutions are inadequate as they are either single-source tools, lack intelligence, are overly complex, or do not offer any AI-driven enhancements. The increasing prevalence of distributed work and advancements in AI make an intelligent task enhancement platform like Syntaskio not only possible but also highly anticipated by users.
