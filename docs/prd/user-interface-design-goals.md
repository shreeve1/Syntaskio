# User Interface Design Goals
Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be centered on creating an intelligent command center for knowledge work. The interface must be clean, focused, and respect the user's attention by prioritizing simplicity and progressive disclosure. A dark mode-first aesthetic will be prioritized to reduce eye strain and enhance focus, particularly for users who often work in low-light environments. It should empower users by adding "superpowers" to their existing tasks without creating additional clutter or cognitive load.

Key Interaction Paradigms

Unified View: A single, streamlined task list that aggregates items from all connected sources. This view will be the primary user interface.

Progressive Enhancement: By default, each task will show only a single, critical AI-generated insight. Full, detailed assistance (including guides, diagrams, and code) will be available only when the user explicitly requests it by clicking "Enhance this task.".

Seamless Source Integration: Users can click through any task to open it directly in its source system (e.g., ConnectWise, Process Plan). Marking a task complete in Syntaskio will sync that status back to the original platform.

Core Screens and Views
Conceptually, the MVP will require the following primary views:

Unified Task Dashboard: The main interface displaying the aggregated list of all tasks.

Task Detail/Enhancement View: A view or modal that appears when a user clicks "Enhance this task," containing the detailed AI-generated assistance.

Integration Settings: A page where users can manage their connections to source systems (ConnectWise, Process Plan, Microsoft Todo).

User Login/Authentication: Standard screens for user sign-up and login.

Accessibility: WCAG AA

Assumption: We will target WCAG 2.1 AA as the compliance standard to ensure the product is accessible to a wide range of users.

Branding

No specific branding guidelines have been provided. The aesthetic should be modern, clean, and professional, with a strong emphasis on a dark mode-first design. The color palette and component styling should be optimized for a dark theme to reduce eye strain and enhance focus. The UI should prioritize clarity and readability to minimize visual distraction, aligning with the core value of reducing cognitive load.

Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a responsive web app, optimized for a seamless experience on both desktop and tablet devices. A mobile-specific application is out of scope for the MVP.
