# Technical Assumptions
Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will be developed within a single monorepo to streamline development and simplify dependency management between the frontend and backend services.

Service Architecture

The backend will be built using a microservices architecture. This approach is chosen to support scalability and allow for independent development and deployment of different parts of the system, such as the task aggregation service and the AI enhancement service.

Testing ## Requirements

Recommendation: To ensure a high-quality, reliable product, I recommend adopting a full testing pyramid strategy. This includes unit tests for individual functions, integration tests to verify interactions between microservices, and end-to-end tests for critical user workflows. This comprehensive approach is crucial for managing the complexities of a multi-service, AI-integrated application.

Additional ## Technical Assumptions and Requests

Frontend: The user interface will be developed using either React or Next.js.

Backend: The microservices will be developed using Node.js or Python.

Database: The primary database will be PostgreSQL, chosen for its reliability and robust support for JSON data types.

Hosting/Infrastructure: All services will be hosted on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

AI Integration: The AI enhancement feature will be powered by the Perplexity API.

Authentication: All integrations with external services must use the OAuth2 protocol.
