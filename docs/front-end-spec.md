Overall UX Goals & Principles
Target User Personas

Tech-Savvy Professionals: The primary users are developers, IT professionals, and project managers aged 25-45. They are highly comfortable with technology, use multiple SaaS tools daily, and are looking for ways to reduce context switching and gain efficiency. They value quick answers and intelligent assistance to complete tasks without deep research.

Usability Goals

Efficiency of Use: Radically reduce the time lost to context switching between task platforms. The interface should enable users to manage their cross-platform tasks faster than using the source systems.

Ease of Learning: The application must be immediately intuitive. A new user should be able to connect a source and understand the value proposition within minutes.

High Memorability: The experience should be straightforward enough that infrequent users can return and use the application effectively without needing to relearn its core functions.

Design Principles

Clarity and Focus Above All: The design will prioritize a clean, dark-mode interface that minimizes visual clutter and cognitive load, allowing the user to focus on their tasks.

Progressive Disclosure: To avoid overwhelming the user, we will show only the most critical AI insight by default. Deeper, more complex information will be revealed only upon explicit user request ("Enhance this task").

Intelligence on Demand: The user is always in control. AI enhancements are a powerful, on-demand tool, not an intrusive force. The experience should feel like an intelligent assistant, not an automated system.

Seamless Integration: The application is a layer on top of other tools, not a replacement. The experience of navigating to a source task or syncing a completion status must be frictionless and reliable.

Information Architecture (IA)
Site Map / Screen Inventory
The following diagram illustrates the primary screens and their relationships for the MVP. The application is centered around the main dashboard.

Code snippet

    A[User Enters App] --> B{Logged In?}
    B -->|No| C[Login / Auth Screen]
    B -->|Yes| D[Unified Task Dashboard]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Task Detail / Enhancement View]
    D --> F[Settings Page]
    F --> G[Integration Management]
    F --> H[Logout]
Navigation Structure

Primary Navigation: After login, the primary view will be the Unified Task Dashboard. A user avatar or menu icon in the header will provide access to "Settings" and "Logout" functions. The navigation will be minimal to maintain focus on the task list itself.

Secondary Navigation: No secondary navigation is required for the MVP due to the flat and focused nature of the application.

Breadcrumb Strategy: Breadcrumbs are not necessary for the MVP's shallow architecture. Navigation will be clear and direct without needing this additional layer.

User Flows
User Onboarding & First Integration

User Goal: To sign up, log in, and connect their first task management tool to see immediate value.

Entry Points: The application's main landing page.

Success Criteria: The user has a registered account, has successfully connected at least one source (e.g., Microsoft Todo), and can see their tasks populated on the dashboard.

    K --> L[View Populated Task List]
Edge Cases & Error Handling:

The user cancels the OAuth process.

OAuth authentication fails or returns an error.

The source system's API is temporarily unavailable.

Viewing and Enhancing a Task

User Goal: To get detailed, AI-powered assistance on a specific task from their aggregated list.

Entry Points: The Unified Task Dashboard.

Success Criteria: The user successfully retrieves and views the multi-format AI enhancement for a task.

    E --> F[Modal/View Appears with Detailed AI Content]
    F --> G[User Reads Guide, Views Diagram/Code]
    G --> H[User Closes Enhancement View]
    H --> A
Edge Cases & Error Handling:

The AI enhancement API call fails or times out.

The AI returns low-quality or irrelevant information.

The system fails to correctly render a Mermaid diagram or code snippet.

Completing a Task

User Goal: To mark a task as complete in Syntaskio and have that status change reflected in the source system.

Entry Points: The Unified Task Dashboard.

Success Criteria: The task is visually marked as complete in the Syntaskio UI, and the status is successfully updated in the source system within 5 seconds.

    E --> F[Backend calls source API to update task]
    subgraph " "
    direction TB
    D
    end
Edge Cases & Error Handling:

The user is offline when they mark a task complete.

The source system's API is down, and the sync fails.

The task was already completed or deleted in the source system, causing a sync conflict.

Wireframes & Mockups
Primary Design Files: The definitive, high-fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes will be maintained in a dedicated design file. This file will be the single source of truth for all visual and interaction design.

Key Screen Layouts

Screen: Unified Task Dashboard

Purpose: To provide the user with a clean, scannable, and focused view of all their aggregated tasks. This is the central hub of the application.

Key Elements:

Header: A minimal header containing the application name/logo and a user menu icon (for accessing Settings and Logout).

Search and Filter Bar: Positioned below the header, this will contain a text input for search and controls for filtering by task source.

Task List: The main content area, displaying tasks in a vertical list. Each task item will include the task title, source indicator, the single AI key insight, and a checkbox for completion.

Interaction Notes: The layout will be spacious and adhere to the dark mode-first aesthetic. The focus will be on readability and creating a calm, organized feel.

Design File Reference: [Link to specific Dashboard frame/artboard to be added]

Screen: Integration Settings Page

Purpose: To allow users to easily connect, view the status of, and manage their integrations with source systems.

Key Elements:

Available Integrations List: A section displaying the available sources (ConnectWise, Process Plan, Microsoft Todo) with a "Connect" button for each.

Connected Integrations List: A section showing currently active integrations, their status (e.g., "Syncing," "Error"), and an option to manage or disconnect them.

Interaction Notes: The process of adding a new connection should be simple and clearly guide the user through the OAuth flow. Status indicators should be clear and provide immediate feedback.

Primary Background	#1A1A2E	Main application background, sidebars.
Secondary Background	#2D2D44	Content panels, cards, modals.
Primary Accent	#8A2BE2	Selected items, primary buttons, highlights.
High Priority Accent	#E53E3E	High priority tags, errors.
Text (Primary)	#F7FAFC	Headings, primary text content.
Text (Secondary)	#A0AEC0	Subheadings, labels, secondary text.
Borders / Dividers	#4A5568	Separators, component borders.

Export to Sheets
Typography

Font Family: A clean, modern sans-serif typeface (e.g., Inter, Poppins) will be used to ensure high readability on digital screens.

Type Scale: A clear hierarchy will be established with distinct sizes and weights for headings (H1, H2, H3), body text, and labels to guide the user's eye and structure information effectively.

Iconography

Icon Library: A library of simple, line-art icons will be used for clarity and consistency across the application.

Spacing & Layout

Grid System: The layout will be based on a consistent grid system (e.g., an 8pt grid) to ensure precise alignment and visual harmony between all UI elements.

Spacing: Generous spacing will be used to prevent the interface from feeling cramped and to improve the scannability of task lists.

Accessibility Requirements
Compliance Target

Standard: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA.

Key Requirements

Visual:

Color Contrast: All text and meaningful UI components will meet or exceed a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against their background to ensure readability.

Focus Indicators: All interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields) must have a clear and highly visible focus state, making keyboard navigation straightforward.

Text Sizing: Users must be able to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

Interaction:

Keyboard Navigation: All functionality must be operable through a keyboard interface alone, without requiring a mouse.

Screen Reader Support: The application will be tested for compatibility with modern screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to ensure a seamless experience for visually impaired users.

Touch Targets: On touch-enabled devices like tablets, all interactive targets will be large enough to be easily tapped.

Content:

Alternative Text: All meaningful images and icons that convey information will have descriptive alternative text.

Heading Structure: The application will use a logical and semantic heading structure (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to facilitate page navigation.

Form Labels: All form inputs (e.g., login, search, settings) will have clear, programmatically associated labels.

Testing Strategy

Accessibility will be a continuous effort, involving a combination of automated testing tools (like Axe) integrated into the development pipeline, manual keyboard and screen reader testing for key user flows, and inclusion of accessibility checks in the standard quality assurance process.

Responsiveness Strategy
Breakpoints
While mobile applications are out of scope for the MVP, the web application will be responsive to ensure it functions correctly on narrow browser windows and a variety of tablet devices.

Breakpoint	Min Width	Max Width	Target Devices
Mobile	-	767px	Narrow browser windows
Tablet	768px	1023px	Portrait & Landscape Tablets
Desktop	1024px	-	Standard Desktops, Laptops

Export to Sheets
Adaptation Patterns

Layout Changes: The application will use a fluid grid system that adjusts to the screen width. On narrower tablet views, side margins may be reduced, and the main task list will reflow to occupy the available space comfortably.

Navigation Changes: The primary navigation will remain consistent across all supported screen sizes to maintain a familiar user experience. The user menu in the header will adapt its contents gracefully for smaller screens if needed.

Content Priority: On smaller tablet screens, less critical information within the task list (e.g., secondary metadata) may be hidden behind a collapsible element to prioritize the task title and its source, ensuring the interface remains clean and scannable.

Animation & Micro-interactions
Motion Principles

Functional & Purposeful: All animations must serve a clear purpose, such as providing feedback, guiding the user's attention, or smoothing a transition between states.

Subtle & Fast: Motion will be quick and unobtrusive. Animations will be brief (typically 150-300ms) to ensure the interface feels responsive and performant.

Consistent: Animation patterns will be applied consistently for similar actions throughout the application to create a predictable and harmonious experience.

Key Animations

State Transitions: Interactive elements like buttons and list items will have subtle transitions for hover, focus, and active states. (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)

Loading Indicators: When fetching tasks or generating an AI enhancement, a clean loading indicator (e.g., a subtle shimmer effect on the content area) will be displayed.

Task Completion: Marking a task complete will trigger a satisfying but quick animation, such as the task item gracefully fading out. (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

Modal Transitions: The AI Enhancement view will use a gentle fade-in and fade-out transition to provide a smooth context shift for the user. (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)

Performance Considerations
Performance Goals

Page Load: The initial application load time should be under 3 seconds on a standard internet connection.

Interaction Response: The UI should acknowledge user interactions (e.g., clicks, keyboard input) in under 100ms.

Animation FPS: All animations should maintain a consistent 60 frames per second (FPS) to appear smooth and fluid.

Next Steps
Immediate Actions

This completed UI/UX Specification should be reviewed by all project stakeholders for final approval.

The high-fidelity visual designs and interactive prototypes should now be created in a dedicated design tool (e.g., Figma), using this document as the definitive guide.

This document is now ready to be handed off to the Architect to begin the creation of the fullstack architecture.
