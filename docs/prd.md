## Goals and Background Context
Goals:

Launch an MVP within 4 months that includes core aggregation and AI enhancement features.

Achieve an 85% user retention rate after 30 days of use.

Reduce the average time users spend on task completion by 30%.

Reach a milestone of 1,000 active users within six months of the official launch.

Background Context:
The primary problem Syntaskio aims to solve is the fragmentation of tasks across multiple platforms, which leads to inefficiencies such as context switching and a lack of clear guidance on how to complete complex tasks. Knowledge workers currently spend approximately 2.5 hours each day managing tasks across different systems and lose about 20% of their work time searching for information to complete these tasks. Existing solutions are inadequate as they are either single-source tools, lack intelligence, are overly complex, or do not offer any AI-driven enhancements. The increasing prevalence of distributed work and advancements in AI make an intelligent task enhancement platform like Syntaskio not only possible but also highly anticipated by users.

## Requirements
Functional ## Requirements:

FR1: Multi-Source Aggregation: The system must connect to and aggregate tasks from ConnectWise Manage (both tickets and projects), Process Plan (active processes), and Microsoft Todo.

FR2: Real-Time Synchronization: The system must maintain real-time, bi-directional synchronization of task status with the source systems.

FR3: Unified Task Display: The platform will present all tasks in a single, clean, and scannable list that includes clear indicators for the source of each task. Completed tasks will be automatically archived.

FR4: Smart De-duplication: The system will intelligently identify and merge tasks that are similar or duplicates from across the different integrated platforms.

FR5: AI-Powered Enhancement: Each task will display a single, key insight generated by AI (using Perplexity) by default. A user-initiated "Enhance this task" option will provide more detailed, multi-format assistance, including text guides, Mermaid diagrams, and code snippets.

FR6: Source-Cited AI Content: All content generated by the AI enhancement feature must include citations for its sources.

FR7: Core Task Interaction: Users must be able to click on a task to navigate directly to it in the source system. They must also be able to mark a task as complete, which will sync back to the source. The interface must provide basic filtering and search functionality.

Non-Functional ## Requirements:

NFR1: Platform & Browser Support: The application must be a responsive web platform, optimized for both desktop and tablet use. It must support the two most recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

NFR2: Performance: The user-facing application must achieve a page load time of less than 3 seconds. The AI enhancement feature must deliver its results in under 3 seconds.

NFR3: Synchronization Reliability: The synchronization between Syntaskio and the source systems must be at least 99.9% accurate.

NFR4: Integration Security: All connections to external services must be secured using the OAuth2 protocol.

NFR5: Cost Efficiency: Given the self-funded nature of the MVP, the infrastructure and services used must be optimized for cost-efficiency.

NFR6: API Rate Limit Compliance: The system must operate within the API rate limits defined by the source systems (ConnectWise, Process Plan, Microsoft).

## User Interface Design Goals
Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be centered on creating an intelligent command center for knowledge work. The interface must be clean, focused, and respect the user's attention by prioritizing simplicity and progressive disclosure. A dark mode-first aesthetic will be prioritized to reduce eye strain and enhance focus, particularly for users who often work in low-light environments. It should empower users by adding "superpowers" to their existing tasks without creating additional clutter or cognitive load.

Key Interaction Paradigms

Unified View: A single, streamlined task list that aggregates items from all connected sources. This view will be the primary user interface.

Progressive Enhancement: By default, each task will show only a single, critical AI-generated insight. Full, detailed assistance (including guides, diagrams, and code) will be available only when the user explicitly requests it by clicking "Enhance this task.".

Seamless Source Integration: Users can click through any task to open it directly in its source system (e.g., ConnectWise, Process Plan). Marking a task complete in Syntaskio will sync that status back to the original platform.

Core Screens and Views
Conceptually, the MVP will require the following primary views:

Unified Task Dashboard: The main interface displaying the aggregated list of all tasks.

Task Detail/Enhancement View: A view or modal that appears when a user clicks "Enhance this task," containing the detailed AI-generated assistance.

Integration Settings: A page where users can manage their connections to source systems (ConnectWise, Process Plan, Microsoft Todo).

User Login/Authentication: Standard screens for user sign-up and login.

Accessibility: WCAG AA

Assumption: We will target WCAG 2.1 AA as the compliance standard to ensure the product is accessible to a wide range of users.

Branding

No specific branding guidelines have been provided. The aesthetic should be modern, clean, and professional, with a strong emphasis on a dark mode-first design. The color palette and component styling should be optimized for a dark theme to reduce eye strain and enhance focus. The UI should prioritize clarity and readability to minimize visual distraction, aligning with the core value of reducing cognitive load.

Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a responsive web app, optimized for a seamless experience on both desktop and tablet devices. A mobile-specific application is out of scope for the MVP.

## Technical Assumptions
Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will be developed within a single monorepo to streamline development and simplify dependency management between the frontend and backend services.

Service Architecture

The backend will be built using a microservices architecture. This approach is chosen to support scalability and allow for independent development and deployment of different parts of the system, such as the task aggregation service and the AI enhancement service.

Testing ## Requirements

Recommendation: To ensure a high-quality, reliable product, I recommend adopting a full testing pyramid strategy. This includes unit tests for individual functions, integration tests to verify interactions between microservices, and end-to-end tests for critical user workflows. This comprehensive approach is crucial for managing the complexities of a multi-service, AI-integrated application.

Additional ## Technical Assumptions and Requests

Frontend: The user interface will be developed using either React or Next.js.

Backend: The microservices will be developed using Node.js or Python.

Database: The primary database will be PostgreSQL, chosen for its reliability and robust support for JSON data types.

Hosting/Infrastructure: All services will be hosted on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

AI Integration: The AI enhancement feature will be powered by the Perplexity API.

Authentication: All integrations with external services must use the OAuth2 protocol.

## Epic List
Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Initial Task Aggregation: Establish the core project infrastructure, including the monorepo, cloud services, and user authentication, while delivering initial value by successfully aggregating and displaying tasks from Microsoft Todo.

Epic 2: Advanced Integration & Smart Synchronization: Expand aggregation to include the more complex ConnectWise and Process Plan sources, and implement the core real-time synchronization and smart de-duplication features.

Epic 3: AI Enhancement & Core User Interactions: Integrate the Perplexity AI to provide on-demand task enhancements, including key insights, detailed guides, and source citations, and implement final user interactions like filtering and search.

Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Initial Task Aggregation
Epic Goal: The goal of this epic is to establish the complete technical foundation for the Syntaskio application, including the project structure, cloud infrastructure, and a working authentication system. By the end of this epic, we will deliver the first piece of tangible user value: the ability for a user to log in and see a unified list of their tasks aggregated from a single source, Microsoft Todo. This initial increment will validate the core architecture and provide a solid base for future integrations.

Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Initial Setup

As a Developer,

I want the monorepo and initial frontend/backend application shells to be set up,

so that I have a clean, consistent structure to begin building features.

Acceptance Criteria:

A monorepo is created with package management configured.

A basic Next.js frontend application is scaffolded within the monorepo.

A basic Node.js backend service is scaffolded within the monorepo.

Root-level configuration for TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier is in place to enforce code quality.

Both frontend and backend applications can be started and run concurrently.

Story 1.2: User Authentication

As a new user,

I want to be able to sign up and log in to the application,

so that I can securely access my personal task information.

Acceptance Criteria:

User authentication is implemented using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Identity Platform.

The UI includes functional sign-up and login pages.

A user can successfully create an account and log in.

Once logged in, the user's session is securely managed.

A logged-in user can successfully log out.

Story 1.3: Microsoft Todo Integration

As an authenticated user,

I want to connect my Microsoft Todo account to Syntaskio,

so that the application can aggregate my tasks from that source.

Acceptance Criteria:

A user can initiate an OAuth2 connection to their Microsoft account from the Integration Settings page.

Upon successful authorization, the system securely stores the necessary tokens to access the Microsoft Graph API.

A backend service is created that can use the stored token to fetch a list of tasks for the authenticated user from the Microsoft Todo API.

The integration handles API errors and token refresh scenarios gracefully.

Story 1.4: Unified Task Dashboard UI

As a logged-in user with a connected Microsoft Todo account,

I want to see all my Microsoft Todo tasks displayed in a unified list,

so that I can view my tasks in one central place.

Acceptance Criteria:

A "Unified Task Dashboard" UI is created and accessible after login.

The dashboard calls the backend service to fetch tasks from all connected sources (initially just Microsoft Todo).

The fetched tasks are displayed in a clean, responsive list.

Each task in the list clearly indicates "Microsoft Todo" as its source.

The UI functions correctly on both desktop and tablet screen sizes.

Epic 2: Advanced Integration & Smart Synchronization
Epic Goal: Building upon the foundation of Epic 1, the goal of this epic is to integrate the remaining, more complex data sources: ConnectWise Manage and Process Plan. This epic will also deliver the sophisticated backend logic for real-time, bi-directional synchronization and the intelligent de-duplication of tasks, which are core differentiators of the Syntaskio platform.

Story 2.1: ConnectWise Manage Integration

As an authenticated user,

I want to connect my ConnectWise Manage account,

so that Syntaskio can aggregate my assigned tickets and project tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:

A user can initiate an OAuth2 connection to their ConnectWise Manage account from the Integration Settings page.

The backend service can securely store and use the authorization token to fetch data.

The service correctly retrieves both open service tickets and active project tasks assigned to the user.

Tasks from ConnectWise are correctly displayed on the Unified Task Dashboard with a "ConnectWise" source indicator.

Story 2.2: Process Plan Integration

As an authenticated user,

I want to connect my Process Plan account,

so that Syntaskio can aggregate my active processes.

Acceptance Criteria:

A user can initiate an OAuth2 connection to their Process Plan account from the Integration Settings page.

The backend service can securely store and use the authorization token to fetch data.

The service correctly retrieves all active processes assigned to the user.

Tasks from Process Plan are correctly displayed on the Unified Task Dashboard with a "Process Plan" source indicator.

Story 2.3: Bi-Directional Status Synchronization

As a user,

I want to mark a task as complete within Syntaskio and have that status reflected in the original system,

so that I don't have to update tasks in two different places.

Acceptance Criteria:

When a task is marked "complete" in the Syntaskio UI, a request is sent to the backend.

The backend service correctly identifies the source system of the task.

The service makes an API call to the source system (e.g., Microsoft Todo, ConnectWise) to update the task's status to complete.

The change is reflected in the source system within 5 seconds.

The system includes error handling for failed synchronization attempts.

Story 2.4: Smart Task De-duplication

As a user with tasks from multiple sources,

I want the system to automatically identify and merge duplicate tasks,

so that my unified list is clean and I don't see the same work item multiple times.

Acceptance Criteria:

A backend process is implemented to analyze tasks from all sources for potential duplicates based on title, description, and other metadata.

When a duplicate is identified, the tasks are merged into a single entry in the Syntaskio UI.

The merged task entry clearly indicates all of its source systems (e.g., shows both "ConnectWise" and "Microsoft Todo" indicators).

Completing a merged task updates the status in all of its source systems.

Epic 3: AI Enhancement & Core User Interactions
Epic Goal: This final epic delivers the primary "intelligent" value proposition of Syntaskio. It focuses on integrating the Perplexity AI service to provide both a default key insight for every task and deep, on-demand assistance. We will also implement the remaining core UI interactions, such as filtering and search, to make the unified task list fully functional for the MVP launch.

Story 3.1: AI Key Insight Generation

As a user,

I want to see a single, critical insight on each task automatically,

so that I can get immediate value and context without any extra clicks.

Acceptance Criteria:

A backend service is created that sends task data (title, description) to the Perplexity API for analysis.

The service successfully processes the API response to extract a single, concise insight.

This key insight is stored and associated with the corresponding task in the Syntaskio database.

The key insight is displayed by default on each task card in the Unified Task Dashboard UI.

Story 3.2: On-Demand Detailed AI Enhancement

As a user needing help with a task,

I want to click an "Enhance this task" button to receive detailed, multi-format assistance,

so that I can understand and complete the task without leaving the application.

Acceptance Criteria:

A backend service is created that, upon request, sends a detailed query to the Perplexity API for a specific task.

The service can process and store multi-format responses, including text guides, Mermaid diagram syntax, and code snippets.

All AI-generated content includes source citations as provided by the API.

The generated content is displayed to the user in a clean, readable format (e.g., a modal or a detail view).

The system correctly renders text, Mermaid diagrams, and formatted code snippets within the UI.

Story 3.3: Task Filtering and Search

As a user with many tasks,

I want to be able to filter and search my unified task list,

so that I can quickly find the specific items I need to work on.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Unified Task Dashboard UI includes a search input field.

As the user types in the search field, the task list dynamically filters to show only tasks that match the keyword(s).

The UI includes controls to filter tasks by their source system (e.g., show only ConnectWise tasks).

The search and filter functionalities can be used together.
