# Security and Performance
Security Requirements
Frontend: Strict Content Security Policy (CSP), secure HttpOnly cookies for tokens.

Backend: Input validation via NestJS Pipes, rate limiting, strict CORS policy.

Performance Optimization
Frontend: Next.js code splitting, client-side caching with TanStack Query.

Backend: Database indexing, Redis caching for expensive operations.
