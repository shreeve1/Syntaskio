# Testing, Coding, Error Handling, and Monitoring Standards
Testing Strategy: Adherence to the testing pyramid with Vitest for unit/integration tests and Playwright for E2E tests.

Coding Standards: Critical rules enforced via ESLint, including mandatory use of the shared types package and repository pattern for data access.

Error Handling: A standardized error format will be used for all API responses, managed by a global exception filter in the backend.

Monitoring: Google Cloud Operations for backend services and a client-side tool like Sentry for the frontend.
